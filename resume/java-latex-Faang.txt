\item \textbf{Warehouse Management System}\\ {A warehouse management system was developed using Java and Spring Boot's microservice architecture. Integration of Apache Kafka enabled real-time data streaming and event-driven communication among the microservices. Data persistence and retrieval were implemented using PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. RESTful APIs were designed and developed to facilitate seamless communication between different modules of the system. The system incorporated business logic, algorithms, and Java multithreading techniques to optimize performance and handle concurrent requests. Additionally, security measures such as authentication and authorization protocols were implemented using industry-standard frameworks.}
